MemeMe v2 app was made as part of "UIKit Fundamentals" course on Udacity.

In the v2 of the app, the user can only make a meme after clicking an image or slecting an image from the gallery. The memes created will be visible as long as the app is active. There is no data persistance yet

The app has the following implemented:
1. Notification System
2. Editable Textviews
3. Shifting the view up to accomodate the keyboard (for case where the keyboard blocks the textview)
4. TableView and CollectionView
5. Navigation bars and Navigation Controllers

V1 of the meme me app is available here: https://github.com/isha04/memeMe_V1
